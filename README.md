View hosted app here:  https://coloryourspace.herokuapp.com/

ColorSpace is a design tool for turning your photos into color inspiration for your home.
You can use images in your personal collection or download and save images from the internet.

### How to use this app:

1. Choose a photo with colors you love. Your memories make for great inspiration.
   Don't have any personal photos? Upload images of famous art,
   landscapes, or anything that inspires you.
2. Submit your photo for analysis. Your custom color swatches will
   display in seconds, along with a guide for how to use your new, inspired color palate.
3. Choose paint colors or shop for furniture - with no need to print
   your results. Our responsive mobile site enables you to
   take your inspiration with you.


### User Stories:

1. I want to redecorate my living room using a photo Iâ€™ve taken for inspiration.

2. I want to use colors from a photograph I found online to choose new decorations for our forest inspired office space.  

3. I want to save my color palate to reference later when purchasing paint, furniture or accent pieces.  

4. I want to create color palates for multiple spaces in my home and save them under specific room labels.
