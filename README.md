You can use images in your personal collection or download and save images from the internet.

   Don't have any personal photos? Upload images of famous art,
   landscapes, or anything that inspires you.
2. Submit your photo for analysis. Your custom color swatches will
   display in seconds, along with a guide for how to use your new, inspired color palate.

   your results. Our responsive mobile site enables you to
   take your inspiration with you.
